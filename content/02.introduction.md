## Introduction

Accurate predictions of protein-ligand binding free energies are a key goal of computational chemistry.
Despite this, calculations of protein-ligand binding thermodynamics involve a number of challenging choices, including the choice of empirical force field, specifying the protonation state of ionizable residues, adding hydrogens or otherwise adjusting the initial protein structure, and placing the ligand in the binding pocket, for which there is no consensus in the computational chemistry community.
Predictions of protein-ligand absolute binding free energies have achieved root mean square errors around 1-2 kcal/mol for "well-behaved" systems [@doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0170-6; @doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00275; @doi:10.1039/c9md00017h], with deviations an order of magnitude larger for some protein families with slow degrees of freedom [@doi:10.1021/jacs.6b11467].
Relative free energy calculations on a series of congeneric ligands, using proprietary methods, have also achieved root mean square errors compared to experiment of around 1 kcal/mol [@doi:10.1021/ja512751q; @doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01026].
Yet, it is not possible to determine how much of the predicted error can be attributed to each of the decisions made by the modeler.

By minimizing the ambiguities involved in modeling protein-ligand complexes, host-guest systems offer a way to isolate and directly probe force field error. 
A variety of techniques for computing absolute binding free energies in host-guest systems have shown accuracy of ~1 kcal/mol, as highlighted in the recent SAMPL5 and SAMPL6 blind challenges [@doi:10.1007/s10822-016-9974-4; @doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0170-6].
These techniques include both quantum and classical dynamics, employing a range of energy and solvation models, with some techniques having knowledge-based steps, docking, or clustering [@doi:10.1021/ct4005992; @doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0154-6; @doi:10.1007/s10822-016-9948-6; @doi:10.1007/s10822-016-9965-5; @doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405; @doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0144-8; @doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0166-2; @doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0153-7].
The attach-pull-release (APR) method has consistently been ranked among the most accurate techniques for predicting binding thermodynamics of host-guest complexes in blind challenges [@doi:10.1007/s10822-016-9974-4; @doi:10.1007/s10822-014-9735-1]. 
In APR, the reversible work of transferring the guest from the binding site to solution, via a physical pathway, is computed using a series of umbrella sampling windows.
Simulating each window and integrating over the partial derivative of the restraint energy with respect to the restraint target is used to generate a potential of mean force along the pulling coordinate, yielding the binding free energy at standard state, ΔG.
Subtracting the mean potential energies obtained from long simulations of the solvated bound complex and the solvated dissociated complex can be used to determine the binding enthalpy at standard state, ΔH.
Together, ΔG and ΔH can be combined to determine the binding entropy, ΔS.
Thus, APR provides a complete thermodynamic description of binding---ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS---that are all absolute quantities for any host and guest

Cyclodextrins, in particular, are ideal host molecules.
They are neutral across the pH range, with well-characterized structures [@doi:10.1021/cr9700181], and bind both small molecule fragments and drug-like guest molecules with reasonable affinity [@doi:10.1007/s10953-018-0769-1].
Moreover, cyclodextrins are stable in numerous conditions and their aqueous solubitilty allows a range of different experimental techniques to be used to measure their binding to guests [@doi:10/bxthjg].
Here, we report the calculation of binding free energies, enthalpies, and entropies of drug-like guest molecules to α- and β-cyclodextrin host molecules, converged to within ~0.1 kcal/mol, using the attach-pull-release method.
These calculations offer an opportunity to benchmark---and ultimately optimize---new and existing force fields.

SMIRNOFF99Frosst, released in late 2018, is the first force field produced by the Open Force Field Initiative [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00640; @url:https://openforcefield.org].
SMIRNOFF99Frosst is derived from AMBER parm99 [@doi:10.1080/07391102.1999.10508297] and Merck's parm@Frosst [@url:http://www.ccl.net/cca/data/parm_at_Frosst/].
Instead of relying on atom types to assign force field parameters to compounds, which is the procedure followed by the `tleap` program that parameterizes molecules in AmberTools, SMIRNOFF99Frosst and the Open Force Field Toolkit use the local chemical environment of each atom to apply force field parameters using SMIRKS strings [@url:http://daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smirks/].
This process simplifies and effectively uncouples the parameters for each term in the force field.
That is, the addition of a new Lennard-Jones parameter does not require the addition of new bonded, angle, and dihedral parameters involving the same atom. 
These factors lead to a much more lean force field specification; there are over 3000 lines of parameters in GAFF v1.7 [@doi:10.1002/jcc.20035], over 6000 lines of parameters in GAFF v2.1, and just 322 lines of parameters in SMIRNOFF99Frosst version 1.0.5 [@url:https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/blob/13c6453a17b275f8dc421d7cc8b3ec12baf4a24f/smirnoff99Frosst/smirnoff99Frosst.ffxml].
It is important to note that SMIRNOFF99Frosst is not yet optimized---simply compressed--at this stage; subsequent work will focus on optimizing SMIRNOFF99Frosst and other SMIRNOFF-family force fields to fit experimental data [@doi:10.0.51.84/RG.2.2.27587.86562].

Thus far, SMIRNOFF99Frosst has been tested on hydration free energies of 642 small molecules, and the densities and dielectric constants of 45 pure organic liquids [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00640].
Here, we benchmark SMIRNOFF99Frosst, GAFF v1.7, and GAFF v2.1 using noncovalent binding thermodynamics using two flexible host molecules and thirty three guests containing three different functional group moieties.
We first show that SMIRNOFF99Frosst does about as well as the conventional force fields, GAFF v1.7 (on both absolute errors and correlation) and GAFF v2.1 (on absolute errors), predicting experimental binding free energies, enthalpies, and entropies.
We then characterize the differences in host conformations sampled by SMIRNOFF99Frosst compared to the other force fields.
