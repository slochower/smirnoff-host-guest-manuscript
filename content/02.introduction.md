## Introduction

The accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies is a key goal of computational chemistry, with key applications in early stage drug discovery.
However, calculations of protein-ligand binding thermodynamics still involve a number of challenging choices, including the choice of empirical force field, specifying the protonation states of ionizable residues, adding hydrogens and otherwise adjusting the initial protein structure, and positioning the candidate ligand in the binding pocket.
Predictions of protein-ligand absolute binding free energies have achieved root mean square errors around 1-2 kcal/mol for "well-behaved" systems [@doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0170-6; @doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00275; @doi:10.1039/c9md00017h], with deviations an order of magnitude larger for some protein families with slow degrees of freedom [@doi:10.1021/jacs.6b11467].
Retrospective relative free energy calculations on a series of congeneric ligands, using proprietary methods, have also achieved root mean square errors compared to experiment of around 1 kcal/mol [@doi:10.1021/ja512751q; @doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01026; @doi:10.26434/chemrxiv.7653434].
However, it is not possible to determine how much of the prediction error can be attributed to each of the decisions made by the modeler, as opposed to accuracy limitations of the force field.

By minimizing the ambiguities involved in modeling protein-ligand complexes, host-guest systems offer a way to isolate and directly probe force field error.
A variety of techniques for computing absolute binding free energies in host-guest systems have shown accuracy of ~1 kcal/mol, as highlighted in the recent SAMPL5 and SAMPL6 blind challenges [@doi:10.1007/s10822-016-9974-4; @doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0170-6].
These techniques include both quantum and classical dynamics, employing a range of energy and solvation models, with some techniques having knowledge-based steps, docking, or clustering [@doi:10.1021/ct4005992; @doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0154-6; @doi:10.1007/s10822-016-9948-6; @doi:10.1007/s10822-016-9965-5; @doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00405; @doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0144-8; @doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0166-2; @doi:10.1007/s10822-018-0153-7].
The attach-pull-release (APR) method has consistently been ranked among the most reliable techniques for predicting binding thermodynamics of host-guest complexes in blind challenges [@doi:10.1007/s10822-016-9974-4; @doi:10.1007/s10822-014-9735-1].
In APR, the reversible work of transferring the guest from the binding site to solution, via a physical pathway, is computed using a series of umbrella sampling windows.
Simulating each window and integrating over the partial derivative of the restraint energy with respect to the restraint target, in each window, is used to generate a potential of mean force along the pulling coordinate, yielding the binding free energy at standard state, ΔG° after applying an analytic correction to account for the effective concentration of the guest during the simulation [@doi:10/dkv3sk].
Furthermore, subtracting the mean potential energies obtained from long simulations of the solvated bound complex and the solvated dissociated complex yields the binding enthalpy, ΔH [@doi:10.1021/ct5004109].
Together, ΔG° and ΔH can be combined to determine the binding entropy at standard state, ΔS°.
Thus, APR provides the complete thermodynamic signature of a host-guest binding reaction: ΔG°, ΔH, and −TΔS°.

Cyclodextrins, in particular, are ideal host molecules for testing computational methods.
They are neutral across a broad pH range, with well-characterized structures [@doi:10.1021/cr9700181], and bind both small molecule fragments and drug-like guest molecules with reasonable affinity, from near -1 kcal/mol to about -5 kcal/mol in the present work [@doi:10.1007/s10953-018-0769-1], and with higher affinity for some cyclodextrin derivatives [@doi:10.1007/s10953-018-0769-1].
Moreover, cyclodextrins are stable in a wide range of experimental conditions and their high millimolar aqueous solubility allows a range of different experimental techniques to be used to measure their binding to guests [@doi:10/bxthjg].
Here, we report the calculation of binding free energies, enthalpies, and entropies of small guest molecules with functional groups often found in drugs to α- and β-cyclodextrin host molecules, converged to within 0.1 kcal/mol statistical uncertainty, using the APR method.
These calculations offer an opportunity to benchmark---and ultimately optimize---new and existing force fields.

The first force field produced by the Open Force Field Initiative, SMIRNOFF99Frosst v1.0.5, was released in late 2018 [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00640; @url:https://openforcefield.org].
It is derived from AMBER parm99 [@doi:10.1080/07391102.1999.10508297] and Merck's parm@Frosst [@url:http://www.ccl.net/cca/data/parm_at_Frosst/].
Instead of relying on atom types to assign force field parameters to compounds, which is the procedure followed by the `LEaP` program used to assign parameters to molecules in AmberTools [@raw:amber2018], SMIRNOFF99Frosst and the Open Force Field Toolkit use separately defined local chemical environments for each atom, bond, angle, and dihedral, to apply force field parameters specified by SMIRKS strings [@url:http://daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smirks/].
This process simplifies and effectively uncouples the parameters for each term in the force field. For example, the addition of a new Lennard-Jones parameter does not require creating a new atom type that forces the addition of new bonded, angle, and dihedral parameters.
This approach leads to a much leaner force field specification; there are over 3000 lines of parameters in GAFF v1.7 [@doi:10.1002/jcc.20035], over 6000 lines of parameters in GAFF v2.1, and just 322 lines of parameters in SMIRNOFF99Frosst v1.0.5 [@url:https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst/blob/13c6453a17b275f8dc421d7cc8b3ec12baf4a24f/smirnoff99Frosst/smirnoff99Frosst.ffxml].
It is important to note that SMIRNOFF99Frosst is not yet optimized at this stage, only compressed; subsequent work will focus on optimizing SMIRNOFF99Frosst and other SMIRNOFF-family force fields to fit quantum and experimental data [@doi:10.13140/RG.2.2.27587.86562].
In the following text, SMIRNOFF99Frosst refers to version 1.0.5 of the force field, unless otherwise noted.

Thus far, SMIRNOFF99Frosst has been tested on hydration free energies of 642 small molecules and the densities and dielectric constants of 45 pure organic liquids [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00640].
Here, we benchmark SMIRNOFF99Frosst, GAFF v1.7, and GAFF v2.1 using noncovalent binding thermodynamics for 43 host-guest complexes (including two hosts and 33 unique guests) for which experimental thermodynamics data are available, representing three different functional group moieties.
We first compare the results of SMIRNOFF99Frosst with those of the conventional force fields GAFF v1.7 and GAFF v2.1, based on calculations of experimental binding free energies, enthalpies, and entropies.
We then characterize the differences in host conformations sampled by SMIRNOFF99Frosst compared to the other two force fields.
