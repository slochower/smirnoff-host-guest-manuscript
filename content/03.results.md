## Results and discussion

This results section is organized as follows. We first present a comparison of SMIRNOFF99Frosst and two iterations of the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF [@doi:10.1002/jcc.20035]) on predicting binding free energies (ΔG) and binding enthalpies (ΔH) of small molecule guests to α-cyclodextrin (αCD) and β-cyclodextrin (βCD). 
We then detail how the conformational preferences of guest molecules changes between force fields and finally we summarize the parameter differences between SMIRNOFF99Frosst and GAFF along with the effects of the parameter differences. 

### Binding free energies and enthalpies

SMIRNOFF99Frosst does about as well as, or even better than GAFF v1.7 on predicted ΔG and ΔH compared to the values measured with isothermal titration calorimetry, despite having far fewer numerical parameters.
SMIRNOFF99Frosst has an overall deviation from experiment of under 1 kcal/mol on binding free energies and under 2 kcal/mol on binding enthalpies across the 43 host-guest systems (@fig:dG-dH and Table @tbl:dG-overall).
Overall, the correlation between SMIRNOFF99Frosst and experiment is mediocre, ranging from an R$^2$ value of 0.34 to 0.54 for ΔG.
The results are more varied for ΔH with R$^2$ ranging from 0.09 to 0.54.
In particular, SMIRNOFF99Frosst underestimates the binding free energy and binding enthalpy of cyclic alcohols and mostly underestimates the binding entropy ([@fig:TdS]).
Guests containing ammonium or carboxylate functional groups appear to be equally over- and under-estimated for binding free energy.

Notably, SMIRNOFF99Frosst does better on αCD than βCD ([@fig:dG-dH-by-cyclodextrin]).

Comparison of calculated absolute binding free energies (ΔG) and binding enthalpies (ΔH) with experiment with SMIRNOFF99Frosst parameters (top), GAFF v1.7 parameters (middle), or GAFF v2.1 parameters (bottom) applied to both host and guest. The orange, blue, and purple coloring distinguish the functional group of the guest as an ammonium, alcohol, or carboxylate, respectively.

Table: Predicted thermodynamic properties for each force field relative to experiment. {#tbl:statistics}

Likewise, GAFF v1.7 has very similar properties with an RMSE for ΔG of 0.88 kcal/mol and RMSE for ΔH of 2.54 kcal/mol.
Both SMIRNOFF99Frosst and GAFF v1.7 systematically underestimate the binding free energy for cyclic alcohols except for beta-cyclodextrin with cyclopentanol (b-cpe).

Overall, GAFF v2.1 has a larger RMSE than either SMIRNOFF99Frosst or GAFF v1.7 on binding free energies, but strikingly strong correlations with the experimental values across all three functional group classes.
Compared to SMIRNOFF99Frosst and GAFF v1.7, GAFF v2.1 uniformly overestimates both the binding free energy and binding enthalpy.

SMIRNOFF99Frosst does a great job predicting the binding free energy of αCD with alcohols, with four of the five points nearly falling on the line of identity.

[Show highlights here]{.banner .lightgrey}

Likewise, SMIRNOFF99Frosst does a great job with amines (?) with three of the four points falling nearly on the line of identity.

With βCD, on teh other hand, things are a little different: two of the three carboxylates are overestimated, ammoniums are great, but the alcohols are all over the place (two overestimated, two understimated.)

This difference is likely because... (?) of flexibility? (Is alpha more flexible than beta?)

### Guest preferences for primary and secondary binding

There are two orientations for binding: one where the primary functional group is interacting with the more narrow opening primary alcohols and one with the polar group oriented out of the wider, secondary opening.

The experimental data is a Boltzmann weighted ensemble of these two orientations.

### Differences in force field parameters between SMIRNOFF99Frosst and GAFF

Next, we summarize the parameter differences between SMIRNOFF99Frosst, a decendent of parm@Frosst and GAFF v1.7 (released circa March 2015 according to `gaff.dat` distributed with AMBER16) and GAFF v2.1 (under active development).

The σ and ε parameters are identical between SMIRNOFF99Frosst and GAFF v1.7
Compared to GAFF v2.1, SMIRNOFF99Frosst has deeper well depths for oxygens and decreased σ values for the hydroxyl hydrogens.

</div>

Compared to GAFF v1.7, SMIRNOFF99Frosst tends to have slightly larger bond force constants, except for the $\ce{O-H}$ hydroxyl bond force constant, which is much stronger.
In GAFF v2.1, the $\ce{O-H}$ hydroxyl bond force constant is consistent with SMIRNOFF99Frosst, but the carbon-oxygen bond constants are weaker.
Equilibrium bond lengths are very similar ([@fig:bond-req]).

</div>

Relative to GAFF v1.7 and GAFF v2.1, SMIRNOFF99Frosst has fewer unique angle parameters applied to αCD; several distinct parameters appear to be compressed into a single force constant, around 50 kcal/mol/rad^2^.
These parameters correspond to $\ce{C-C-C}$, $\ce{C-O-C}$, and $\ce{O-C-O}$ angles.
The $\ce{C-C-C}$ angles are primarily around the ring of the glucose monomer.
The $\ce{C-O-C}$ angles are both around the ring and between monomers (e.g., $\ce{C1-O1-C4}$ and $\ce{C1-O5-C5}$).
Weaker force constants for these parameters may  lead to increased flexibility.

The third dihedral, affecting atoms O1<sub>n</sub>--C4<sub>n+1</sub>--C5<sub>n+1</sub>--O5<sub>n+1</sub> is quite significantly different, with multiple minima and and barrier heights. This dihedral partially controls the rotation of glucose monomers towards or away from the interior of the cyclodextrin cavity.

### Structural consequences of the force field parameter differences

In both SMIRNOFF99Frosst and GAFF v1.7, the average RMSD of βCD is between 2 and 2.5 Å over 43 μs of simulation. GAFF v2.1 is significanly more rigid, with an average RMSD less than 1.0 Å from the initial structure ([@fig:flexibility]).

![Top: Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of free βCD in the three force fields, all relative to the same initial structure. A 1000 frame moving average is plotted in red. Middle: to-view of the open cavity of βCD with no guest (200 snapshots over 1 μs). Bottom: side-view of the open cavity. The carbons are colored blue in SMIRNOFF99Frosst, green in GAFF v1.7, and purple in GAFF v2.1. Hydrogen atoms have been hidden for clarity.](images/cyclodextrin-flexibility.png){#fig:flexibility width=100%}
